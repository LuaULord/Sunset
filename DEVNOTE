*Read me before trying to develop stuff using this library, the script requires proper installation to work fully.

*Ill try to explain how the script works & how to use it for projects

*The meanings of all files

- coloring = file that is made for changing colors in UI

- version = file to get current version, letters meanings: 
     - A = Alpha
     - B = Beta
     - T = Testing
- userinput = file that manages main UI

- libs = folder that used for listing libraries in UI that you can use to load stuff

*The way to create your library to run, install something:

----------------------------------------------------------

--this is tutorial for creating library, for sunset script

--so lets begin with creating test to make sure, script is running in state we want.
--the state means, mode executor run in.

--[==[
There are 3 states in sunset script,
  0 - failed mode, and resources/assets isnt installed,
  1 - normal mode, where all required stuff is installed,
  2 - safe mode, this mode is used for testing stuff and mostly 
      maded for developers, ill explain what it is later.
  ]==]

--making sure the enviroment is fully loaded.
if __SS_State and __SS_State ~= 0 then return end


--Creating New Unregistered Library
local mod=__SS_CreateLib("Test") -- -> table

--Now ill explain what each index in table do
--[==[
   __unloaded - expected to be function, that runs on unloading library
                from sunset
                ARGUMENTS: void
  
  __loadup    - expected to be table with functions, that import on 
                load of library
  
  __on_response - expected to be function, that activate on any type of
                  response for example [[error,warn,print]]
                  if is not set, all responses will log into sunset console
                  ARGUMENTS: string
  
  __on_register - expected to be function, that will run on :Register() 
                  function inside library
                  ARGUMENTS: void
  
  ]==]

  --heres example of an command:

   local list={apple = { function(arguments:{string}) 
     local message="Heres " 
      if arguments[1] then
         message..="Apple"
        else
         message..="Pumpkin Pie"
      end
      print(message)
   end,
      description="Prints Some Food Name!", sh_args=false,argsexp=0   
                        
                       }
               
  -- sh_args - should command have arguments or not, if its arguments
  --           are not totally equal as expected

  -- argsexp - expected arguments used on running commands, if equal to 
  --           zero then it will dont have limit, although there 
  --           is exception, that if sh_args turned on, it will expect
  --           to be zero arguments used

  --description - the description that will pop up on index of commands


  mod.__on_register=function()
     print("Its working!")
  end
               
  -- Registers Library, allowing its commands to run
  mod:Register() -- logs into console "Its working!"

  --we can also create log in sunset ui
  __SS_Log(unpack({
    "-", -- header, and only one byte is allowed to use
    "Hello Sunset!", -- description
    Color3.fromRGB(255,255,255) -- textcolor3,
    })
