*Read me before trying to develop stuff using this library, the script requires proper installation to work fully.

*Ill try to explain how the script works & how to use it for projects

*The meanings of all files

- coloring = file that is made for changing colors in UI

- version = file to get current version, letters meanings: 
     - A = Alpha
     - B = Beta
     - T = Testing
- userinput = file that manages main UI

- libs = folder that used for listing libraries in UI that you can use to load stuff

*The way to create your library to run, install something:

----------------------------------------------------------

--this is tutorial for creating library, for sunset script

--so lets begin with creating test to make sure, script is running in state we want.
--the state means, mode executor run in.

--[==[
There are 3 states in sunset script,
  0 - failed mode, and resources/assets isnt installed,
  1 - normal mode, where all required stuff is installed,
  2 - safe mode, this mode is used for testing stuff and mostly 
      maded for developers, ill explain what it is later.
  ]==]

--making sure the enviroment is fully loaded.
if __SS_State and __SS_State ~= 0 then return end


--Creating New Unregistered Library
local mod=__SS_CreateLib("Test") -- -> table

--Now ill explain what each index in table do
--[==[
   __unloaded - expected to be function, that runs on unloading library
                from sunset
                ARGUMENTS: void
  
  __loadup    - expected to be table with functions, that import on 
                load of library
  
  __on_response - expected to be function, that activate on any type of
                  response for example [[error,warn,print]]
                  if is not set, all responses will log into sunset console
                  ARGUMENTS: string
  
  __on_register - expected to be function, that will run on :Register() 
                  function inside library
                  ARGUMENTS: void
  
  ]==]

  --heres example of an command:

   local list={apple = { function(arguments:{string}) 
     local message="Heres " 
      if arguments[1] then
         message..="Apple"
        else
         message..="Pumpkin Pie"
      end
      print(message)
   end,
      description="Prints Some Food Name!", sh_args=false, argsexp=0   
                        
                       }
               
  -- sh_args - should command have arguments or not, if its arguments
  --           are not totally equal as expected

  -- argsexp - expected arguments used on running commands, if equal to 
  --           zero then it will dont have limit, although there 
  --           is exception, that if sh_args turned on, it will expect
  --           to be zero arguments used

  --description - the description that will pop up on index of commands

  print(__FOLDER) -- logs the folder path, which can be used to 
  --                 run more stuff in folder

  --Returns user info table if player is not on server,
  --Or if he is, will return it
  print(__SS_GetUserByInfo("Roblox").UserId)
  --or
  print(__SS_GetUserByInfo(1).UserId)
  --or if we use as finding player path by short name
  local lplr=game.Players.LocalPlayer
  print(__SS_GetUserByInfo((lplr.DisplayName or lplr.Name):sub(5)).Name)

  mod.__on_register=function()
     print("Its working!")
  end
               
  -- Registers Library, allowing its commands to run
  mod:Register() -- logs into console "Its working!"

  --we can also create log in sunset ui
  __SS_Log(unpack({
    "-", -- header, and only one byte is allowed to use
    "Hello Sunset!", -- description
    Color3.fromRGB(255,255,255) -- textcolor3,
    })
  
----------------------------------------------------------


-----------------------------------
*Now when i explained all stuff that add on sunset script run
i can show how to run them correctly

Lets create folder, with name of whatever we want.
My will be named "Apples"
now when we created folder, we need to create file named "main.luau"
after that we have the file, which will be ran, and other stuff that
you wrote should be in it, since if library will be loaded, this file 
would be ran firstly.

*Now if you wanna add it to "libs" folder, you can test it faster 
by just putting the folder in executor workspace, then running this:

---------------------------------
local folder_path="Apples" --This path will be used in environment
--of main.luau as "__FOLDER"

--Runs folders "main.luau"
__SS_Run(folder_path)
---------------------------------

there are reason to use method i showed above instead of 
putting file in libs, its because of sunset wouldn't 
accept any folders that are used to be in list more than
one time.

----------------------------------
